### Task 1

Write a Python function that extracts user input and searches `text-paypal.py` for a matching one. The program should output all matching inputs in the form of a sentence (the sentence ends with a dot ( . )).<br><br>
When entering user data, provide 3 input options. Answers must be true(True) or false(False)

- It looks for sentences where it starts with user input. (^)
- It looks for sentences where it ends with user input. ($)

<i>NOTE: Use only regular expression!
HINT: use split, search methods of regex</i>

**Input:** <br>
String: Word that you want to search
Bool element(^): True or False (lower or upper cases when checked in a code)
Bool element($): True or False (lower or upper cases when checked in a code)
Bool element(\d): True or False (lower or upper cases when checked in a code)

**Output:** <br>
Return sentences that matched the conditions.

### Task 4

### Task 5

You are given information about 20 restaurants in `restaurants` dictionary from `data.py` file.<br />Your goal is to write a function that converts `restaurants` dictionary as follows:<br />

```
result = {
    0: {
        restaurants_restaurant_R_res_id: 16668008
        restaurants_restaurant_apikey: 10a35f36f5898432823df42bc743c8aa
        restaurants_restaurant_id: 16668008
        restaurants_restaurant_name: Arigato Sushi
        ...
    },
    1: {
        restaurants_restaurant_R_res_id: 801690
        restaurants_restaurant_apikey: 10a35f36f5898432823df42bc743c8aa
        restaurants_restaurant_id: 801690
        restaurants_restaurant_name: Mocha
        ...
    },
    ...
    19: {
        ...
    }
}
```

with all information.<br />Result is a nested dictionary: <br />- key is a number of restaurant<br />- value is a dictionary containing information about the restaurant that has keys according to the `ids` list from `data.py` file.<br />
NOTE: use Regex methods in this exercise.

### Task 6

### Task 7

Image you are machine learning engineer. You should preprocessing data (cleaning from unnecessary characters) in order to classificate messages to spam or not spam. You have a list of messages in `text.py`

What should you do:

1. cleaning messages from unnecessary characters `[",",  ".", ";" .............]`
2. convert all messages to lower words `str.lower()`
3. delete all spaces that are more > 1 and the last space from string `str.rstrip()`
4. use function `map` to delete unwanted space `map(function that delete unwanted space, iterable object)`

`Note` You can use library re in order to solve this problem.
