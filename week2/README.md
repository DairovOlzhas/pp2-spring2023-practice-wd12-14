### Task 12

You are given a positive integer n.<br/>
You have n pair, for each pair you have key - type and value.<br/>
If key - `str`, you add value into array.<br/>
If key - `bool`, you sort array. If value - True, in ascending order, value - False, in descending order.<br/>
If key - `int`, you take sublist of array from value index. If index is invalid, do nothing.<br/>
If key - `set`, you add value into array, then remove all duplicates.<br/>
Otherwise, add key at the start of the array and value at the end of the array.<br/>

<b>Example:</b>

<b>Input:</b>

```
6
str Hello  
float 1.5 
set float
dict None  
bool False
int 2
```

<b>Output:</b> `['None', 'Hello', '1.5']`
